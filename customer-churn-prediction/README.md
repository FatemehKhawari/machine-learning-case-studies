# Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview

This project develops a machine learning classification system to predict whether a customer is likely to leave a service.

Customer churn prediction is an important real-world machine learning problem because companies can use predictive models to identify high-risk customers and design retention strategies.

This project demonstrates a complete supervised learning workflow, including data analysis, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and comparison.

## Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:

* Analyze customer behavior data
* Identify factors related to customer churn
* Build classification models
* Compare different machine learning algorithms
* Evaluate models using appropriate classification metrics

---

## Dataset

The dataset contains information about customers, including demographic information, services used, account characteristics, and customer behavior.

The target variable is:

* **Churn**

  * 1: Customer leaves the service
  * 0: Customer stays

The dataset includes both:

* Numerical features
* Categorical features

---

## Machine Learning Workflow

The project follows these steps:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
2. Data cleaning
3. Feature preprocessing
4. Train-test split
5. Model training
6. Model evaluation
7. Model comparison

---

## Data Preprocessing

The following preprocessing techniques are applied:

* Handling missing values
* Removing unnecessary features
* Encoding categorical variables using One-Hot Encoding
* Scaling numerical features using StandardScaler

The dataset is divided into:

* 80% training data
* 20% testing data

A fixed random state is used for reproducibility.

## Machine Learning Models

The following classification algorithms are implemented:

### Logistic Regression

A linear probabilistic classifier used as a baseline model.

### Decision Tree

A tree-based model capable of learning nonlinear decision rules.

### Random Forest

An ensemble method combining multiple decision trees to improve prediction stability.

### Gradient Boosting

A boosting algorithm that builds sequential models to reduce prediction errors.

---

## Evaluation Metrics

Because churn datasets are often imbalanced, accuracy alone is not sufficient.

The models are evaluated using:

### Accuracy

Overall percentage of correct predictions.

### Precision

Measures how many predicted churn customers are actually churn customers.

### Recall

Measures how many actual churn customers are successfully identified.

### F1-score

Balances precision and recall.

### ROC-AUC

Measures the model's ability to separate churn and non-churn customers.
